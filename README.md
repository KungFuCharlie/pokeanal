Pokemon Analysis

Quick attempt at visualizing where you are most likely to find any given pokemon
in the areas covered by the scanner the dbs were exported form. 

Eventually may add more statistical analysis based on date/time of the spawn.

If you have a Google Maps API Key, put it in a file in the main directory named
google_maps_api_key.txt.

USAGE:
$ python pokeanal.py
